This project demonstrates the use of C++ template programming, including function templates, array manipulation, and iterators. The exercises cover the basics of generic programming and showcase how to write reusable code for various data types. The goal is to implement function templates for common operations, create a dynamic array class, and use iterators to apply operations on arrays.
